      \    - world lines (0D+1D)\n    - world sheets (1D+1D)\n    - world volume (2D+1D)\n\
      \    - spacetime (3D+1D).\n\nDisjointness means that 'item'-s cannot have multiple-dimensional\
      \ representations.\n\nCOMMENT:\nAn 'item' is a fundamental mereotopological\
      \ (MT) entity, so that the primitive property of enclosure can be defined for\
      \ it.\n\nMT relations occurs only between 'item' individuals. 'item' is the\
      \ highest superclass for all wholes and parts.\n\n'item'-s are always topologically\
      \ connected spaces (a topological space X is said to be disconnected if it is\
      \ the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. Otherwise, X is said to be connected).\n\
      \nIn the EMMO the 'item' individuals exists in a 4D substrate. 'item' individuals\
      \ span through time (1D) and space (3D) dimensions and sub-dimensions.\n\nCOMMENT:\n\
      Parthood relations does not change dimensionality of an 'item' individual (e.g.\
      \ a 4D individual has only 4D parts, a spacetime has\nno space parts).\n\nChanges\
      \ in dimensionality come from pure topological relations between subspaces (i.e.\
      \ slicing).\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe 'item' class and all its sub-classes are 'set'\

  SIGN:
    definition: "COMMENT:\nA 'sign' can have temporal-direct-parts which are 'sign'\
      \ themselves.\n\nA 'sign' usually have 'sign' spatial direct parts only up to\
      \ a certain elementary semiotic level, in which the part is only a 'physical'\
      \ and no more a 'sign' (i.e. it stands for nothing). This elementary semiotic\
      \ level is peculiar to each particular system of signs (e.g. text, painting).\n\
      \nJust like an 'elementary' in the 'physical' branch, each 'sign' branch should\
      \ have an a-tomistic mereological part.\n\nCOMMENT:\nAccording to Peirce, 'sign'\
      \ includes three subcategories:\n- symbols: that stand for an object through\
      \ convention\n- indeces: that stand for an object due to causal continguity\n\
      - icon: that stand for an object due to similitudes e.g. in shape or composition\n\
      \nCOMMENT:\nIn a 4D ontology one could question if a 'sign' should be defined\
      \ as a spatial direct part of a 'semiosis' i.e. a proper part of a 'semiosis'\
      \ during all its existence.\n\ne.g. one can say that an unread text is not a\
      \ 'sign': it was a 'sign' during the 'semiosis' process in which it was written,\
      \ but after that it is something else, until somebody read it again.\n\nHowever,\
      \ this is not the case for an ontology, since declaring an individual under\
      \ the 'sign' class (a semiosis outside the EMMO, a meta-semiosis) is equivalent\
      \ to say that for the ontologist (an interpreter outside the EMMO, a meta-interpreter)\
      \ the real entity (an object outside the EMMO, a meta-object) is a 'sign'.\n\
      \nSo the 'semiosis' process within the EMMO is about how other 'interpreter'-s\
      \ deal with the 'sign'-s here declared.\n\nCOMMENT:\nIt can be defined as the\
      \ semiotic branch of the EMMO.\n\n'sign' subclasses categorize the type of signs\
      \ that are used to create representations/models of the real world entities.\n\
      \nEXAMPLE:\nA novel is made of chapters, paragraphs, sentences, words and characters\
      \ (in a direct parthood mereological hierarchy). \n\nEach of them are 'sign'-s.\
      \ \n\nA character can be the a-tomistic 'sign' for the class of texts.\n\nThe\
      \ horizontal segment in the character \"A\" is direct part of \"A\" but it is\
      \ not a 'sign' itself.\n\nFor plain text we can propose the ASCII symbols, for\
      \ math the fundamental math symbols.\"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#PlainLiteral>"

      ''set'' class can be used to declare individuals that stand for collections

      e.g. the set of users of a particular software, the set of atoms that have been
      part of that just dissociated molecule, or even the set of atoms that are part
      of a molecule considered as single individual entities and not a mereological
      fusion.


      COMMENT:

      A ''set'' individual cannot be member of a ''set'' (to avoid Russel''s paradox).


      COMMENT:

      Since OWL classes are intended as sets, we can consider the ''set'' branch as
      a meta-ontological branch, since ''item'' class and all its subclasses are then
      individuals of ''set''.


      It is also possible to define a relation ''is_subset_of'' valid only between
      ''set'' individuals that is equivalent to the OWL-DL built-in ''is_a'' relation
      between classes in the ''item'' branch.


      However this is not done in the EMMO for the sake of simplicity.'

    definition: 'COMMENT:

      A ''physical'' is the class that contains all the individuals that stands real
      world perceivable entities.


      Real world entities must be perceived by the ontologist declaring the corresponding
      individual.


      COMMENT:

      A ''physical'' must include at least an ''elementary'' part, but can also include
      void parts.


      A ''physical'' may include as part also the ''void'' surrounding or enclosed
      by its ''physical'' sub parts.


      There are no particular criteria for ''physical''-s structure, except that is
      made of some ''elementary''-s as proper parts and not only ''void''.


      This is done in order to:

      a) take into account the quantum nature of physical systems, in which the actual
      position of sub-components (e.g. electrons in an atom) is not known except for
      its probability distribution function (according to the Copenhagen interpretation.)

      b) take into account the fact that large entities (e.g. devices, cars, materials)
      have some void into them.


      e.g. a ''spacetime'' that has spatial parts an atom and a cubic light year of
      ''void'' extending for some time can be a ''physical'' individual.


      COMMENT:

      A ''physical'' with dimensions other than 3D+1D (i.e. ''physical'' and not ''spacetime'')
      cannot exist, since perception is a process (unfolds in time).


      For this reason, ''physical''-s exist only in space and time (3D + 1D), so ''physical''
      is a subclass of ''spacetime''.


      e.g. you always have an aperture time when you take a picture or measure a property.
      Instantaneous perceptions are idealizations (abstractions) or a very small time
      measurement.


      COMMENT:

      In the EMMO there are no relations such as ''occupies_space'', since ''physical''-s
      are themselves ''spacetime'' entities.


      COMMENT:

      The EMMO can be used to represent real world entities as ''physical''-s that
      are easy to connect to classical or quantum mechanical based models.


      Classical mechanics poses no representational issues, for the EMMO: the 4D representation
      of ''physical''-s is consistent with classical physics systems.


      However, the representation of ''physical''-s that are typically analized through
      quantum mechanics (e.g. molecules, atoms, clusters), is not straightforward.


      1) De Broglie - Bohm interpretation

      The most simple approach is to rely on Bohmian mechanics, in which each particle
      is supposed to exists in a specific position between measurements (hidden variables
      approach), while its trajectory is calculated using a Guiding Equation based
      on a quantum field calculated with the Schroedinger Equation.


      While this approach is really easy to implement in an ontology, since each entity
      has its own well defined 4D region, its mathematical representation failed to
      receive large consensus due to the difficulties to include relativistic effects,
      to be extended to subnuclear scale and the strong non-locality assumtpion of
      the quantum field.


      Nevertheless, the Bohmian mechanics is a numerical approach that is used in
      electronic models to reduce the computational effort of the solution of Schroedinger
      Equation.


      In practice, an EMMO user can declare a ''physical'' individual that stand for
      the whole quantum system to be described, and at the same time all sub-parts
      individuals can be declared, having them a well defined position in time, according
      to De Broglie - Bohm interpretation. The Hamiltonian can be calculated by considering
      the sub-part individuals.


      ''physical''-s are then made of ''physical'' parts and ''void'' parts that stand
      for the space between ''physical''-s (e.g. the void between electrons and nucleus
      in an atom).


      2) Copenhagen interpretation

      In this interpretation the properties (e.g. energy level, position, spin) of
      a particle are not defined in the interval between two measurements and the
      quantum system is entangled (i.e. properties of particles in the sysyem are
      correlated) and described by a global wavefunction obtained solving the Schroedinger
      Equation.


      Upon measurement, the wavefunction collapses to a combination of close eigenstates
      that provide information about bservables of the system components (e.g. position,
      energy).


      The EMMO can be used to represent ''physical''-s that can be related to Copenhagen
      based models. In practice, the user should follow these steps:


      a) define the quantum system as a ''physical'' individual (e.g. an H2 molecule)
      under a specific class (e.g. ''h2_molecule''). This individual is the whole.


      b) define the axioms of the  class that describe how many sub-parts are expected
      for the whole and their class types (e.g. ''h2_molecule'' has axioms ''has_proper_part
      exactly 2 electron'' and ''has_proper_part exactly 2 nucleus)


      c) the user can now connect the whole to a Schroedinger equation based model
      whose Hamiltonian is calculated trough the information coming only from the
      axioms. No individuals are declared for the subparts!


      d) a measurement done on the quantum system that provides information on the
      sub-part observables is interpreted as wavefunction collapse and leads to the
      end of the whole and the declaration of the sub-parts individuals which can
      be themselves other quantum systems


      e.g. if the outer electron of the H2 molecule interacts with another entity
      defining its state, then the whole that stands for the entangled H2 molecule
      becomes a ''physical'' made of an electron individual, a quantum system made
      of one electron and two nuclei and the void between them.


      e.g. in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation the user represent the atom by un-entangling
      nucleus and electronic cloud. The un-entanglement comes in the form of declaration
      of individual as parts.


      e.g. the double slit experiment can be represent in the EMMO as:

      a) before the slit: a ''physical'' that extend in space and has parts ''electron''
      and ''void'', called ''single_electron_wave_function''. ''electron'' and ''void''
      are only in the axioms and not decalred individuals.

      b) during slit passage: a ''physical'' made of one declared individual, the
      ''electron''.

      c) after the slit: again ''single_electron_wave_function''

      d) upon collision with the detector:  ''physical'' made of one declared individual,
      the ''electron''.


      COMMENT:

      The purpose of the ''physical'' branch is to provide a representation of the
      real world entities, while the models used to explain or predict the behaviour
      of the entities lay under the ''semeion'' branch.


      More than one model can be connected to the same ''physical''.

      \nA non-perceivable real world entity does not exist (or it exists on a plane\
      \ of existance that has no intersection with us and we can say nothing about\
      \ it).\n\nPerception/observation of a real wolrd entity occurs when the entity\
      \ stimulate an observer in a peculiar way through a well defined perception\
      \ channel.\n\nFor this reason each property is related to a specific observation\
      \ process which involves a specific observer with its own perception mechanisms.\n\
      \nThe observation process (e.g. a look, a photo shot, a measurement) is performed\
      \  by an observer (e.g. you, a camera, an instrument) through a specific perception\
      \ mechanism (e.g. retina impression, CMOS excitation, piezoelectric sensor activation)\

      \nThis definition can be generalized by using a generic human eye, so that the\

      \ (i.e. 'physicals') are not gained or lost during its temporal extension (they\
      \ exist from the left to the right side of the time interval), so that the granularity\

      \ account the disappearance or appearance of parts within a 'physical'. \n\n\
      A 'state' is a recognizable granularity level of matter, in the sense that its\

      \ a generic 'existent'.\n\nCOMMENT:\nThere is no change in granularity or cardinality\

      \ there is an exchange of molecules between the ice and the water, but this\
      \ does not affect the existence of the two states.\n\nIf we partition the existent\
      \ in my glass as ice surrounded by several molecules (we do not use the object\
      \ water as direct part) then the appearance of a molecule coming from the ice\
      \ will cause a state to end and another state to begin.\"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#PlainLiteral>"
